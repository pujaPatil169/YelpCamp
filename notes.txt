The line app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public'))); in your app.js
 file serves static files (such as CSS, JavaScript, and images) from the public 
 directory. This means that any files placed in the public directory can be 
 accessed directly via your web browser. For example, if you have a file
  public/style.css, it can be accessed at http://localhost:3000/style.css .
  
  express.static is a built-in middleware function in Express to serve static files.

/home/puja/Downloads/programs/web_dev/YelpCamp/
|-- app.js
|-- public/
    |-- style.css
    |-- script.js



Explanation
__dirname: Resolves to /home/puja/Downloads/programs/web_dev/YelpCamp.
path.join(__dirname, 'public'): Joins /home/puja/Downloads/programs/web_dev/YelpCamp and public, resulting in /home/puja/Downloads/programs/web_dev/YelpCamp/public.
This line tells Express to serve static files from /home/puja/Downloads/programs/web_dev/YelpCamp/public. Therefore, if you place style.css inside the public directory, you can access it in the browser via http://localhost:3000/style.css.

How It Works
When a request comes in, Express will look for the requested file in the public directory. For example:

http://localhost:3000/style.css looks for /home/puja/Downloads/programs/web_dev/YelpCamp/public/style.css.
http://localhost:3000/script.js looks for /home/puja/Downloads/programs/web_dev/YelpCamp/public/script.js.
